- [Getting Started](#getting-started)
- [Configuration Options](#configuration-options)
- [Examples](#examples)
- [FAQ](#faq)
- [Ports](#ports)

## Getting Started:

Install with `yarn` or `npm`.

**Yarn:**
```
yarn add react-d3-speedometer
```

**npm:**

```
npm install --save react-d3-speedometer
``` 

And, use it like

```javascript
// import the component
import ReactSpeedometer from "react-d3-speedometer"
// and just use it
<ReactSpeedometer />
```

### Slim Build:

There is a `Slim` build available without bundling `d3`. This project uses `d3` *micro bundles*. If your project also uses `d3` *microbundles*, you can opt for **slim build**. Necessary `d3` dependencies required for slim build to work are - `d3-array`, `d3-color`, `d3-ease`, `d3-format`, `d3-interpolate`, `d3-scale`, `d3-selection`, `d3-shape`, `d3-transition`. 
```javascript
// sample slim build usage
import ReactSpeedometer from "react-d3-speedometer/slim"
// and use it
<ReactSpeedometer />
```

## Configuration Options:

| prop        | type           | default  | comments |
| ------------|:--------------:| --------:| ---------|
| value       | Number         | 0        |   Make sure your value is between your `minValue` and `maxValue`       |
| minValue    | Number         | 0        |          |
| maxValue    | Number         | 1000     |          |
| segments    | Number         | 5        | Number of segments in the speedometer. Please note, `segments` is calculated with [d3-ticks]() which is an approximate count that is uniformly spaced between min and max. Please refer to [d3-ticks](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#continuous_ticks) and [d3-array ticks](https://github.com/d3/d3-array#ticks) for more detailed info.        |
| maxSegmentLabels    | Number         | value from 'segments' prop        | Limit the number of segment labels to displayed. This is useful for acheiving a gradient effect by giving arbitrary large number of `segments` and limiting the labels with this prop. [See Live Example](https://palerdot.in/react-d3-speedometer/?path=/story/react-d3-speedometer--gradient-effect-with-large-number-of-segments-and-maxsegmentlabels-config). Please note, `maxSegmentLabels` is calculated with [d3-ticks]() which is an approximate count that is uniformly spaced between min and max. Please refer to [d3-ticks](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#continuous_ticks) and [d3-array ticks](https://github.com/d3/d3-array#ticks) for more detailed info.        |
| forceRender | Boolean        | false    | After initial rendering/mounting, when props change, only the `value` is changed and animated to maintain smooth visualization. But, if you want to force rerender the whole component like change in segments, colors, dimensions etc, you can use this option to force rerender of the whole component on props change.         |
| width       | Number         | 300      | **diameter** of the speedometer and the **width** of the svg element |
| height      | Number         | 300      | height of the svg element. Height of the speedometer is always half the width since it is a **semi-circle**. For fluid width, please refere to `fluidWidth` config |
| dimensionUnit | String         | px     | Default to `px` for `width/height`. Possible values - `"em" , "ex" , "px" , "in" , "cm" , "mm" , "pt" , ,"pc"` ... Please refer to [specification](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Content_type#Length) for more details |
| fluidWidth  | Boolean        | false    | If `true` takes the width of the parent component. See [Live Example](https://palerdot.in/react-d3-speedometer/?selectedKind=React%20d3%20Speedometer&selectedStory=Fluid%20Width%20view&full=0&down=0&left=1&panelRight=0&downPanel=kadirahq%2Fstorybook-addon-actions%2Factions-panel) for more details |
| needleColor | String         | steelblue | Should be a valid color code - colorname, hexadecimal name or rgb value. Should be a valid input for [d3.interpolateHsl](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate#interpolateHsl)   |
| startColor | String         | #FF471A | Should be a valid color code - colorname, hexadecimal name or rgb value. Should be a valid input for [d3.interpolateHsl](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate#interpolateHsl)   |
| endColor | String         |  #33CC33 | Should be a valid color code - colorname, hexadecimal name or rgb value. Should be a valid input for [d3.interpolateHsl](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate#interpolateHsl)   |
| segmentColors | Array (of colors)         |  [] | Custom segment colors can be given with this option. Should be an array of valid color codes. If this option is given **startColor** and **endColor** options will be ignored. |
| needleTransition | String (JS) / Transition (TS)        | easeQuadInOut | [d3-easing-identifiers](https://github.com/d3/d3-ease) - easeLinear, easeQuadIn, easeQuadOut, easeQuadInOut, easeCubicIn, easeCubicOut, easeCubicInOut, easePolyIn, easePolyOut, easePolyInOut, easeSinIn, easeSinOut, easeSinInOut, easeExpIn, easeExpOut, easeExpInOut, easeCircleIn, easeCircleOut, easeCircleInOut, easeBounceIn, easeBounceOut, easeBounceInOut, easeBackIn, easeBackOut, easeBackInOut, easeElasticIn, easeElasticOut, easeElasticInOut, easeElastic. There is a helper Object/Type 'Transtion', which you can import like `import { Transition } from 'react-d3-speedometer'` and use it like `Transition.easeElastic`. This works for both JS and Typescript. For `type(script)` definitions, please refer [here](./src/index.d.ts). |
| needleTransitionDuration | Number         | 500     | Time in milliseconds. |
| needleHeightRatio | Float (between 0 and 1)         | 0.9     | Control the height of the needle by giving a number/float between `0` and `1`. Default height ratio is `0.9`.  |
| ringWidth | Number         | 60     | Width of the speedometer ring. |
| textColor | String         | #666     | Should be a valid color code - colorname, hexadecimal name or rgb value. Used for both showing the current value and the segment values |
| valueFormat | String       |  | should be a valid format for [d3-format](https://github.com/d3/d3-format#locale_format). By default, no formatter is used. You can use a valid d3 format identifier (for eg: `d` to convert float to integers), to format the values. **Note:** This formatter affects all the values (current value, segment values) displayed in the speedometer |
| segmentValueFormatter | Function | value => value     | Custom segment values formatter function. This function is applied after 'valueFormat' prop if present. |
| currentValueText | String | ${value} | Should be provided a string which should have **${value}** placeholder which will be replaced with current value. By default, current value is shown (formatted with `valueFormat`). For example, if current Value is 333 if you would like to show `Current Value: 333`, you should provide a string **`Current Value: ${value}`**. See [Live Example](https://palerdot.in/react-d3-speedometer/?selectedKind=react-d3-speedometer&selectedStory=Custom%20Current%20Value%20Text&full=0&down=1&left=1&panelRight=0) |
| currentValuePlaceholderStyle | String | ${value} | Should be provided a placeholder string which will be replaced with current value in `currentValueTextProp`. For example: you can use ruby like interpolation by giving following props - `<ReactSpeedometer    currentValueText="Current Value: #{value}" currentValuePlaceholderStyle={"#{value}"} />`. This is also helpful if you face `no-template-curly-in-string` eslint warnings and would like to use different placeholder for current value |
| customSegmentStops | Array         | []     | Array of values **starting** at `min` value, and **ending** at `max` value. This configuration is useful if you would like to split the segments at custom points or have unequal segments at preferred values. If the values does not begin and end with `min` and `max` value respectively, an error will be thrown. This configuration will override `segments` prop, since total number of segments will be `length - 1` of `customSegmentProps`. For example, `[0, 50, 75, 100]` value will have three segments - `0-50`, `50-75`, `75-100`. See [Live Example](https://palerdot.in/react-d3-speedometer/?path=/story/react-d3-speedometer--custom-segment-stops) |
| customSegmentLabels | Array`<CustomSegmentLabel>` | [] | Takes an array of `CustomSegmentLabel` objects. Please note, the array length should match `segments` which is automatically calculated by `d3-ticks`. For more details, please check `segment` prop section. Each object has following keys for custom rendering of labels - `text`, `fontSize`, `color`, `position: OUTSIDE/INSIDE`. For `position`, there is a helper `CustomSegmentLabelPosition` Object/Type which you can import like `import { CustomSegmentLabelPosition } from 'react-d3-speedometer'`, and use it like `CustomSegmentLabelPosition.Inside / CustomSegmentLabelPosition.Outside`. This works for both JS and Typescript. For `type(script)` definitions, please refer [here](./src/index.d.ts).  |
| labelFontSize | String         | 14px     | Font size for segment labels/legends |
| valueTextFontSize | String         | 16px     | Font size for current value text |
| valueTextFontWeight | String         | bold     | Font weight for current value text. Any valid font weight identifier (500, bold etc) can be used. |
| paddingHorizontal | Number         | 0     | Provides right/left space for the label text. Takes a number (without explicit unit, unit will be taken from dimensionUnit config which defaults to px). Helpful when using a bigger font size for label texts. |
| paddingVertical   | Number         | 0     | Provides top/bottom space for the current value label text below the needle. Takes a number (without explicit unit, unit will be taken from dimensionUnit config which defaults to px). Helpful when using a bigger font size for label texts. |
| svgAriaLabel      | String      | React d3 speedometer     | SVG aria-label property for Accessibility purposes |

#### Force Render component on props change - [Live Example](https://palerdot.in/react-d3-speedometer/?path=/story/reactspeedometer--force-render-the-component)

```javascript
// By default, when props change, only the value prop is updated and animated. 
// This is to maintain smooth visualization and to ignore breaking appearance changes like segments, colors etc. 
// You can override this behaviour by giving forceRender: true

// render a component initially
<ReactSpeedometer
  width={200}
  height={200}
/>
// Now, if given forceRender: true, and change the appearance all together, the component will rerender completely on props change
<ReactSpeedometer
  forceRender={true}
  segments={15}
  width={500}
  height={500}
/>
```

#### Needle Height Configuration Example - [Live Example](https://palerdot.in/react-d3-speedometer/?path=/story/reactspeedometer--configure-needle-length-and-font-sizes)
